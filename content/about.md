Hi! I am Justin, a IT geek with a love for automation and security.

I'm not afraid to learn new things and I don't mind getting my hands dirty on an unknown topic. I might set my mind on something I do not know shit about, but I sure as hell will figure it out.

I have been working in IT since 2013 and started as a Ethical Hacker in 2020. Along the way, I picked up about loads of subjects. Yet automation and security, when done right, always gives me that 'spark of joy'.

I try open source my work whenever I can. You can check out my [Github profile here](https://github.com/justin-p) if you are interested.
