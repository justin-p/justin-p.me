Bandit level 27 â†’ level 32 will use our MoreVimShell created in Bandit level 26 â†’ level 27.

### Bandit Level 27 â†’ Level 28

**Level Goal:**
*There is a git repository at ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.*

It seems we now move on to some `git`. If you have no idea what `git` is, give [this a read.](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

Lets setup a workspace where we call pull the `git` repo to.

```
bandit26@bandit:$ mkdir /tmp/giv_git
bandit26@bandit:$ cd /tmp/giv_git
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_pass$
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git$ git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo.git
Cloning into 'repo'...
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:98UL0ZWr85496EtCRkKlo20X3OPnyPSB5tB5RPbhczc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/home/bandit26/.ssh/known_hosts).


bandit27-git@localhost's password:
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git$ ls
repo
```

Lets `cd` into the cloned folder and `cat` whats inside.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git$ cd repo/
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ ls
README
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ cat README
The password to the next level is: 0ef186ac70e04ea33b4c1853d2526fa2
```

### Bandit Level 28 â†’ Level 29

**Level Goal:**
*There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.
*

Lets remove the old repo and clone the new one and `cd` into it.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ cd ..
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git$ rm repo/ -rf
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git$ git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo.git

bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ ls -la

-rw-r--r-- 1 bandit26 root  111 Sep 11 17:11 README.md
```

Since there probably won't be a password in the README.md this time lets look at the `git logs` .

Here we see some previous commits with a reference to a info leak.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ git log

commit b67405defc6ef44210c53345fc953e6a21338cc7
Author: Ben Dover <noone@overthewire.org>
Date:   Tue Oct 16 14:00:39 2018 +0200

    initial commit of README.md
```

Lets git checkout that commit and `cat` the README.md file.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ git checkout 186a1038cc54d1358d42d468cdc8e3cc28a93fcb
Note: checking out '186a1038cc54d1358d42d468cdc8e3cc28a93fcb'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 186a103... add missing data
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ cat README.md

If we `cat` the README.md there is a reference to 'passwords not being allowed in production'. I'd say passwords should not be allowed in version control software, but what do I know.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ cat README.md

```

Anyhow lets see if there are some other branches.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD-> origin/master
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/sploits-dev
```

Lets `git checkout` that `dev` branch and cat the README.md.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ git checkout dev
Branch dev set up to track remote branch dev from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ cat README.md

Lets remove the old repo and clone the new one and `cd` into it.

```

```

Its seems someone placed a 'empty' file here. If we check `git log` we only see 1 commit and there are no other branches. So whats left ? `tags`.

Lets check if there are some tags with `git tag -l` and `git show-ref --tags`.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ cat README.md
just an epmty file... muahaha
andit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo/.git$ git tag -l
secret
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo/.git$ git show-ref --tags
f17132340e8ee6c159e0a4a6bc6f80e1da3b1aea refs/tags/secret
```

Okay so we found some `tag` , how do we show this ? Well with `git show`.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ git show secret

### Bandit Level 31 â†’ Level 32

**Level Goal:**
*There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.
*

Lets remove the old repo and clone the new one and cd into it.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ cd ..

-rw-r--r-- 1 bandit26 root  147 Sep 11 17:35 README.md
```

First things first, lets look at that `.gitignore` file. It seems that someone has setup this `.gitignore` file to exclude all `txt` files.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ cat .gitignore
*.txt
```

Lets look at the README.md.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ cat README.md
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master
```

It wants us to commit and push a file named `key.txt` to the remote repo. As we know from looking at the `.gitignore` file all `txt` files are ignored and unable to be pushed. So lets just create the `key.txt` file with the correct contents and remove the `.gitignore` file.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ vim key.txt
May I come in?
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ rm .gitignore
```

Before we are able to make a `commit` we need to tell `git` who are are.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ git config user.email "they@you.me"
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ git config user.name "they@you.me"
```

Now lets add the `key.txt` file, create a `commit` and `push` it.

```
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ git add key.txt
bandit26@bandit:/tmp/giv_git/repo$ git commit -m "Added key.txt"
[master 091067d] Added key.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 key.txt
